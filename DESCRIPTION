Description: This package makes it easy to create dendrochronological networks based on the similarity between tree-ring series or chronologies. It includes various functions to compare tree-ring curves building upon dplR. The networks can be used to visualise and understand the relations between tree-ring curves. These networks are also very useful to estimate the provenance or wood-use within a structure/context/site.
